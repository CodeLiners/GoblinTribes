Goals
-----

* Goblins that form tribes, build and expand their camp.
* A minimum of AI cheating. As much as possible, goblins will play by the same rules as a player, working for their own survival and gathering resources to build their homes.
* Interaction with the player, for example by trading.
* Goblins that can be surprising, funny, a little bit unpredictable, sometimes dangerous and always going about their business.
* Wage war on other goblin tribes, including siege equipment.
* To add new, immersive and more intelligent life to Minecraft than exists so far.

It's good to have lofty goals, even if they're not fully realized!
